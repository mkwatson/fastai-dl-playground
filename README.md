# Image and Time Series Classification with FastAI

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to both image and time series classification tasks using the FastAI library. It consists of two main notebooks, progressing from a basic image classification task to a more advanced time series classification problem.

## Notebooks

1. [basic.ipynb](basic.ipynb): Pet Image Classification
2. [GAF.ipynb](GAF.ipynb): Time Series Classification using Gramian Angular Fields

### 1. Pet Image Classification (basic.ipynb)

This introductory notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset
- Building and training a convolutional neural network for image classification
- Evaluating the model's performance and analyzing results

Key features:
- Introduces fundamental concepts of image classification with deep learning
- Showcases FastAI's simplicity in building and training models
- Includes data exploration, model training, and performance evaluation

### 2. Time Series Classification (GAF.ipynb)

This more advanced notebook showcases how to:
- Convert time series data into Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images
- Use these images to train a deep neural network for binary classification
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics

Key features:
- Demonstrates the use of image-based techniques for time series data
- Utilizes FastAI's vision models for time series classification
- Includes detailed performance analysis and model calibration
